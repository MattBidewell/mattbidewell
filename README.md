# Hello world 👋

I'm Matt, an engineer at GDS based in London. Building services on AWS with Javascript/Typescript, GoLang, Java or whatever is needed to solve the business problem.

A little about me, I'm passionate about open source software and developing in the open.

I'm always up for working on open source projects, so feel free to reach out!
