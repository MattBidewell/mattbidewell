# Hello world 👋

I'm Matt, I'm an engineer at GDS based in London. Building services on AWS with Javascript/Typescript (nodejs), GoLang or whatever is needed to solve the business problem.

A little about me, I'm passionate about open source software and developing in the open. In my spare time

I'm always up for working on open source projects, so feel free to reach out!
